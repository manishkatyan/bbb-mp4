# bbb-mp4
Easily integrate this app into your BigBlueButton server to automatically convert class recordings into MP4 videos.


## How it works?

After a BigBlueButton class ends, recording process kicks in, which will process recording in three stages - archieve, process and publish. Once recording is published, `/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/post_publish/post_publish.rb` is executed.

In `post_publish.rb`, we invoke `bbb-mp4.sh` with corresponding `meeting_id` to convert recording into mp4 video.

`bbb-mp4.sh` starts a node process to launch Chrome browser with the BigBlueButton playback URL in a Virtual Screen Buffer, that plays the recording and record the screen in WEBM format. 

After compeltion of recording, FFmpeg is used to convert WEBM to MP4 and moved to `/var/www/bigbluebutton-default/recording`.

When you visit the default BBB playback url `https://<your-bbb-fqdn>/playback/presentation/2.0/playback.html?meetingId=<meeting_id>`, either of the following two cases happen:
- MP4 video exists: you are redirect to `https://<your-bbb-fqdn>/recording/<meeting_id>.mp4` to view MP4 video 
- MP4 video doesn't exist: you are redirect to `https://<your-bbb-fqdn>/playback/presentation/2.0/playback_default.html?meetingId=<meeting_id>` to view default playback recording

Hence, you can safely deploy this project on your existing BigBlueButton server. 
- Going forward, all your recordings would get converted into MP4 videos. 
- Older recordings will still be accessible as default BBB playback recording.

##  Install

```sh
# Assuming you install bbb-mp4 project at /var/www/
# SSH to your BigBlueButton server and execute the following commands
cd /var/www
git clone https://github.com/manishkatyan/bbb-mp4.git
cd bbb-mp4
cp env-example .env
```
Edit `.env` to update the following parameters:
1. bbb_fqdn: fully-qualified domain name of your BigBlueButton server (Example - bbb.higheredlab.com)
2. mp4_dir: location where converted MP4 videos should be kept. Leave it at the default value so that you can view MP4 video at `https://<your-bbb-fqdn>/recording/<meeting_id>.mp4`.

```ssh
# Execute the following to install all required packages. 
./bbb-mp4-install.sh
```
`bbb-mp4-install.sh` will install the following packages In Docker :
1. XVFB
2. Google Chrome
3. FFmpeg
4. NodeJS
5. Dependencies

During this installation, `bbb-mp4-install.sh` will also do the following:
- update the default `post_publish.rb` to invoke `bbb-mp4.sh` that will start automatic MP4 conversion after a class recording is published. 
- create a directory `recording` at `/var/www/bigbluebutton-default` to store converted MP4 videos that can be accessed via browser.
- update the default playback at `/var/bigbluebutton/playback/presentation/2.0/playback.html` to redirect to MP4 videos at `/recording`.

```sh
# give bigbluebutton user sudo access
usermod -aG sudo bigbluebutton

# make sudo access passwordless
sudo visudo
# add the following line at the end of the file
bigbluebutton ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
You need to give user bigbluebutton sudo access, as detailed above, for bbb-mp4 to run correctly. 

## How to use it

No changes are required from your side to view MP4 videos created by bbb-mp4. 

As we updated the default playback.html, when you would visit the default playback url - `https://<your-bbb-fqdn>/playback/presentation/2.0/playback.html?meetingId=<meeting_id>` - you would be redirected to the corresponding MP4 video url - `https://<your-bbb-fqdn>/recording/<meeting_id>.mp4`. 

If you are using Greenlight or Moodle, you will continue to use the same way to view MP4 videos.

## Uninstall

In case you want to restore the default playback.html, please follow the steps below:

```sh
mv /var/bigbluebutton/playback/presentation/2.0/playback_default.html /var/bigbluebutton/playback/presentation/2.0/playback.html
mv /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/post_publish/post_publish.rb.default /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/post_publish/post_publish.rb
```
With this, you would be able to restore default playback behavior and default post_poublish action.
